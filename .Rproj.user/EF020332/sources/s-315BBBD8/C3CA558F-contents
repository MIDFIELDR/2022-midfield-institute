The Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD) is a partnership of higher education institutions with engineering programs. Begun in 2004 as an extension of the SUCCEED Longitudinal Database, MIDFIELD contains Student Unit Record (SUR) data for all undergraduate, degree-seeking students at partner institutions. 

As of June 1, 2022, MIDFIELD contains SUR data for 1.7 M undergraduates at 19 institutions with ABET-accredited engineering programs. Of those, 302,631 students declared engineering as a major at some point in their undergraduate education.
