The session should encourage you to: 

- Understand the structure of your data
- Understand the type of question the data can answer 
- Explore different graph types suited to the data and the question 
- Keep reading and learning---an unfamiliar design may be just what you need



**Materials**

- [Download PDF] (in progress) worksheets for think-write-share activities. Hardcopy seems to work best for many people.
