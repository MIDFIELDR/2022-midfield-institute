    "text": "As of June 1, 2022, MIDFIELD contains individual Student Unit Record (SUR) data for 1.7 M undergraduates at 19 institutions with ABET-accredited engineering programs. Of those, 302,631 students declared engineering as a major at some point in their undergraduate education.\nMIDFIELD is a comprehensive resource that includes demographic, enrollment, course performance, and graduation data. A total of 33 institutions have completed Memoranda of Understanding and are expected to be included in the next release."
