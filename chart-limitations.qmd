Our goals in visual rhetoric are  
  
- Improving **perception** of stories in the data
- Facilitating quantitative **reasoning** about the data
- Enhancing our **credibility** with the audience

**Materials**

- [worksheets] (in progress)  I suggest you have a printed copy of these worksheets to write in during the workshop. We have a number of think-write-share activities that for many people work best in writing.
